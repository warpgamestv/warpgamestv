# Lumen Clash

## v1.5.0 — Pre-match hero select (2026-03-27)
### Added
- **Server-driven hero select**: When both players are in a room, the match enters **`HERO_SELECT`** before **`IN_PROGRESS`**. The worker stores each player’s **`hero_select_pick`** / **`hero_select_ready`**, broadcasts **`HERO_SELECT_UPDATE`** (deadline + lock state), and starts the round after both lock in or after a **20s** timeout.
- **Rematch / Best of 3**: After **`GAME_OVER`**, agreed rematches route through **hero select** again so you can swap hero/skin between games while preserving **series** state.

### Changed (website)
- **Hero select UI** stays in sync with the **`HERO_SELECT`** game state (not only “two players waiting”), so the overlay no longer disappears when the server advances past **`WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS`**.
- **Presence**: Hero select counts as **In match** for friend status.
- **Reconnect**: Automatic reconnect also applies during **`HERO_SELECT`**.

### Deploy notes
- **Static site** (`warpgamestv` repo): `lumen-clash/` front end.
- **Worker** (`Lumen-Clash` repo): deploy **`backend/`** with Wrangler so **`HERO_SELECT`** and websocket actions match the client.

## v1.4.0 — Luminary Pass premium UX & profile titles (2026-03-26)
### Added
- **Luminary Pass refresh**: Full-screen **glass / neon** layout aligned with other Lumen menus; clearer rank header and horizontal reward track.
- **Lumens & Premium unlock (client)**: Free-track **Lumens (💠)** milestones and a **progress meter** toward unlocking **Premium** from play (persisted in `localStorage` as `lumen_clash_bp_premium_unlocked` once eligibility is met).
- **Profile → Display title**: Equip **unlocked titles** from the Player Profile screen (with hint text); **Save** persists via the same **`/save-customization`** API used for skins.
- **More pass rewards**: New **Knight/Sage skins** (**Crimson Knight** and **Astral Sage**) plus additional **rank titles** on the Luminary Pass track—for example **Recruit**, **Tactician**, **Arc Warden**, **Starforged**, **Mythbreaker**, **Season Vanguard**, and **Paragon**, alongside existing emote, skin, and credit nodes. _(Ensure your backend grants `unlockedTitles` entries that match these display names when players reach the corresponding ranks.)_
- **Void Weaver — Abyssal & Lumen Legend**: Dedicated textures (`void_weaver_abyssal.png`, `void_weaver_legend.png`) are loaded and swapped like **Verdant**; menu/battle scale compensates when variant PNG resolution differs from the base sprite. Replace the bundled placeholders with your final art when ready.

### Changed
- **Character Customize**: **Skin variant** only in the roster preview modal; **titles** moved to **Profile** so progression and identity are centralized.

### Notes
- **Backend parity**: If titles do not appear after ranking up, update server logic so rank-ups add the new title strings to **`unlockedTitles`** to match the client pass table.

## v1.3.0 — Menu readability & social polish (2026-03-22)
### Added
- **Friend challenges**: **Challenge** on a friend creates a private match and sends a **duel invite** they can accept or decline under Social; challenger waits in the matchmaking overlay.
- **Friend presence**: Friends can show richer status (**In menu**, **In match**, **Private lobby**, **Away**, **Offline**) using a lightweight presence heartbeat to the server.
- **Last chosen character**: The roster class you last picked (or saved customization for) is stored in `localStorage` and drives the **main menu hero** and default queue class after reload.
- **Best of 3 (post-match)**: XP splash adds **Best of 3** beside **Challenge Again**; when both players pick it, subsequent games count toward **first to 2** with a live series line on the splash. Between rounds, only **Next round** is shown until the set is decided.
- **Rematch feedback**: Opponent choice is surfaced (**One more game**, **Best of 3**, **Next round**); if choices conflict, a short message asks you to match.
- **Duel invite toast**: Pending duel invites show a main-menu **banner** with **Open Social** so invites are harder to miss.
- **Main menu header (top right)**: **Pilot** strip shows **username** and **account rank**; **Activity** (bell) opens a small inbox for **friend requests** and **duel invites** (with a footnote that quests, seasonal rewards, and events can land here later).

### Changed
- **Main menu left rail**: Larger typography for **nav labels**, **hints**, the **Luminary Pass** row, and rank badge so sidebar actions are easier to read (including stacked mobile layouts).
- **Accessibility “Larger UI text”**: Sidebar sizes scale up a bit further when that setting is enabled.

### Fixed
- **Local dev API proxy**: Node static server now matches API paths reliably (normalized URL path, proxy-before-files) so POST routes like **`/friend-duel-invite`** reach wrangler instead of returning a filesystem 404; clearer JSON errors when the backend is unreachable.
- **Private room cleanup**: `GameRoom` WebSocket teardown now uses **`this.env`** for the matchmaker client (was a stray `env` reference).
- **XP / rank display**: Account **rank** is derived from class levels, but the UI was pairing it with **lifetime `stats.xp`** and a `rank × 100` curve (wrong). Profile and splash bars now use **sum of class XP / sum of (level×100)** (“roster XP”). Roster class cards use **xp / (level×100)** for their fill. **`/profile`** recomputes rank from stored class levels to fix drift. Default **`add-xp`** class id is **`aegisKnight`** (not `knight`) so XP isn’t stored under a dead key.

## v1.2.0 — Responsive Polish & Character Rendering (2026-03-22)
### Added
- **Settings → Performance overlay**: Optional FPS readout plus approximate **HTTP ping** to `/profile` (round-trip latency), persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Settings → Accessibility**: **Larger UI text**, **high contrast** shell for menus/HUD, **high-visibility HP bar** colors (blue vs amber), and **reduce motion** (cuts CSS animations/transitions).
- **Settings → Combat feedback tuning**: Added user-selectable **Camera shake** and **Hit-stop** intensity levels (`Off`, `Medium`, `High`) that apply during damage reactions.
- **Post-match breakdown**: XP splash now includes match stats (**damage dealt**, **damage taken**, **abilities used**, **turn swaps**) for quick self-review.
- **Settings tabs**: Options are now organized into **Gameplay**, **Accessibility**, and **System** sections for faster navigation.
- **Menu VFX toggle**: Added a gameplay setting to disable animated menu effects for cleaner visuals and lower distraction on mobile.
- **Pretty changelog viewer**: In-game changelog now renders with readable formatting (headings, sections, bullets, emphasis) instead of plain raw text.

### Changed
- **Main menu responsiveness**: Improved behavior across different aspect ratios, including mobile-friendly layout adjustments and better stacking/spacing for narrow viewports.
- **Mobile visual pass (global)**: Refined phone/tablet layout for menu, combat HUD, roster, modals, and splash screens; improved touch target sizing, spacing, and portrait readability.
- **Mobile compact pass**: Reduced button footprint and reorganized portrait HUD flow to minimize overlap (health cards, status/timer, abilities, and emotes now fit with less collision on small screens).
- **UI polish**: Added custom themed scrollbars across scrollable panels and lists.
- **Selected hero presentation**: Active chosen character now appears behind the main menu UI layer for stronger visual identity while preserving menu readability.
- **Void Weaver skin parity**: Fixed **Verdant Void Weaver** scale inconsistencies so it matches standard Void Weaver sizing in menu and battle scenes.
- **Connection resilience**: Added temporary disconnect recovery with automatic reconnect attempts (up to 3) before falling back to manual return.

### Fixed
- **Sprite background artifacts**: Removed visible dark/black matte backgrounds from character sprites when rendered in Phaser and preview contexts.

## v1.1.0 — Main Menu & Presentation (2026-03-22)
### Added
- **Animated menu backdrop**: Linked `background.css` and added the `#menu-background-layer` markup (nebula, particles, scanlines, vignette) so the main menu shows the intended background.
- **Header tagline** under the game title on the main menu.

### Changed
- **Main menu layout**: Professional shell with a **left navigation rail** (Luminary Pass, Team, Rankings, Profile, Social, Settings) and a **primary Play** action anchored **bottom-right** in the main area.
- **Combatant panel**: Right-aligned **glass-style card** (“Active combatant”) with refined typography; Play button uses a dedicated **primary CTA** style (title + “Find a match” subtitle).
- **Responsive behavior**: Main menu **stacks** on narrow or short viewports (`max-width: 720px` or `max-height: 500px`) using rules scoped to the menu so **combat HUD** compact styles still apply only when the viewport is **short**, not merely narrow.
- **Post-match overlay**: `#xp-splash-overlay` moved to the **top of `<body>`** for more reliable stacking and input behavior; splash flow also hides **`#ui-container`** so the HUD does not sit above the results screen.
- **Splash actions**: Rematch and Main Menu on the splash use dedicated handlers with guarded listeners; **Social** included in the global menu **click** sound list.
